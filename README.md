## `Java Development Internship - OASIS INFOBYTE`

Welcome to Oasis Infobyte Java Development Projects repository. This repository contains Java projects, including "Online Examination System, Number Guessing Game and ATM Interface ." These projects are designed to help you improve your Java programming skills and showcase your knowledge.


## Project : `ATM Interface`
The First project  I worked on was an ATM interface. This project was the most challenging , as it required me to develop a console-based application that emulated the functionalities of an ATM machine.
I had to implement features such as displaying a menu of options, prompting the user for input, and updating account balances based on the user's actions. This project helped me develop my skills in Java programming, especially in working with classes, objects, and methods.


##Project : 'Number Guessing Game'
The Number Guessing Game is a simple JavaFX application where the player needs to guess a random number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.
